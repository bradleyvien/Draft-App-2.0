Name,Allias,Affiliation,Bio
Alf Sexton,Gralf,Uncle,15-year tournament veteran. Still isn't sure what golf is yet. Knows what a bud light is though...
Andrew Woehr,Whoer,Friend of Brad,"Finds a way to hit a few key shots every round. Has been showing signs of improvement. High risk, high reward pick in the later rounds of the draft. Invitational rookie."
Andy Steitz,Steitz,DeSmet,It’s tough to Make America Great Again (again) and maintain your golf game.
Andy Vien,Vienner,OG Kid,"Tournament CEO. Lately, he is at his best when on the Valley course or playing in a practice round. Perennial A-Flighter who has not won much in recent years may just decide to make something up to award himself…like say a red jacket. "
Bart Fogelbach,Barty Boi,OG Adult,"C-Flighter with the mentality of a Contender. If you need to make a swing change mid round and want some advice/video analysis, this is your guy. Proudly endorses Kirkland golf products."
Ben Maloney,Ben,Kid,"Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) look-a-like performs well in the post golf, post Mexican food foot races. While sprinters may make for great bobsledders (thanks John Candy), it doesn’t seem translate to the golf. Eins, Swei, Drei! Cool Runnings!"
Brad Vien,B-rad,OG Kid,"Dangerous with a wedge. Also dangerous with a driver, but because of the combination of high ball speed and lack of control. Contender if the big stick is working."
Brendan Huhmann,Brendan Schleicher,Kid,Golfs like a Huhmann. Drinks like a person.
Bryan Foerstel,Bryan,Friend of Brad,A Flighter that mashes. The gallery always loves the power draw but so do the woods.
CB,Michael Bartz,OG Uncle,Former second-team all-conference left back out of Affton High School. Played the role of second string long-snapper to Andy’s Tom Brady in the years of the Dynasty. Will remind you that Wilson still makes golf equipment. Will not make a strong case why Wilson still makes golf equiptment.
Chris Foerstel,Chris,Friend of Brad,C- Flighter with huge upside potential. Could be mistaken for a Huhmann (based on size and hair style) until you see how much better he hits a golf ball.
Chris Vince,Vince,DeSmet,Chirs Vince.
Cole Edwards,Cole,Kid,Q: How’s is he off the tee? A: Power draw. Q: How’s his short game? A: Power draw.
Crig Huhmann,Craig Baby,OG Adult,Have you ever seen someone putt from the rough 75 yards off the green? Golfs like the average human. Drinks like the average Huhmann.
Dan Jennewein,DJ,DeSmet,"Fundamentally, has the best swing in the field. Look out if he gets some confidence going."
Dan Rettke,The Rat,Andy's Frat Bro,Great at generating ball speed. Bad at navigating ball pits and fairways. 
Drew Bearden,Drewwww,OG Kid,"Q: Is that Gilmore again? How many times has this guy tried out? A: At least 10 times. Guys got a lot of intensity. Not the strongest skater, though. Ain't the best puck handler, either. Yeah, but my God…What A Shot! Caution: Fairways on the Valley are indeed regulation size."
Gavin Bryan,,,Former college lacrosse player.
Goose,Joe Funderburk,OG Uncle,When you see that one random goose that’s off flying in a different direction than the others…
Gregg Hollabaugh,Grigg?,Andy's Father-in-law,Good potential to be a solid mini golf player.
Gregory Bryan,Paco,Adult,Don't ask this man to write a short speech. 
Hoey Swain,I own hole number 7 on the valley,OG Adult,"Majority shareholder of hole number 7 on the Valley. If you’re looking for an accurate ball striker in the later rounds, look no further. Will be held resposible if you ring the Motel 6 doorbell at 3am. I don’t wanna name any names about who this is directed at…Swain and Goose."
Jack Stamm,Stamm,DeSmet,Donates money annually to the Vienner fantasy baseball league. Will his philanthropic tendencies carry over to the golf course? We’ll find out in his first Invitational appearance.
Jake Whelchel,Jake the Snake,St. Matthias,"Hits the ball better when it’s sitting down on the ground. If he can figure out how to hit a driver, look for him to move up a flight and up draft boards."
Jeff Haberberger,Jeff,Kid,Was offended when I told him he kind of looked like Swain. Mashes.
Jeff Orbe,Ricky,St. Matthias,Dresses like Ricky Fowler. That’s where the comparison ends. 
JJ Sexton,JJ Pretzel Belly,OG Kid,"Has the most consistent right to left ball flight in the field. Unfortunately, that side spin costs him length off the tee and his chance to hit scoring clubs into most holes. Caddy: ""This is a par 5. I suggest you hit a driver."" JJ: ""I’ll take my wedge."" [Swings. Wins money] ""Driver, huh, well you’re fired."""
Joe Bearden,Big Daddy,OG Adult,Lemay's favorite son is the sharpest dresser in the field also has the best putting stroke and will likely keep the ball in play if there is enough room to bend it back to the left.
Joe Dennis,Lobby Joe,Kid,One of the best all-around players in the field. Look for him at the top of the leaderboard on Friday. Potential #1 seed if the Super 8 ever decides to make an upgrade to the lobby furniture.
Joe Estes,Joe Estes,Adult,Quality player with nice touch around the greens.
Joe Thieman,JT,Friend of Brad,"Capable of hitting some of the most electric shots you’ve ever seen. High risk short game, high reward ball striker. Currently tougher than Michael Joyner."
John Gibson,Gibby,OG Kid,"Hi, I’m a bowler but I’m playing golf today. Former high end Affton Athletic Association high school league pitcher."
John Vonarx,Papa John,OG Adult,Perennial bottom feeder somehow hit a hole-in-one.
Josh Ladig,Little Ladig,OG Kid,Challenger to Kyle Huhmann for the course record.
JR Fogelbach,Jrrrrrr,OG Kid,Former top of the rotation Affton Athletic Association high school league pitcher. Look for him to play solid bogie golf to the middle of the B-flight. Look out if he gets in a grove with the big stick.
Justin Lacy,Lacy,Andy's Frat Bro,Lots of raw power. Little natural consistency. Look for him at the bottom of B or the top of the C flight. Caution: easily tipped over.
Justin Swain,Swain,OG Kid,"According to Happy Gilmore, “Golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass.” And Swain has both. Look for this neon colored, romper wearing, title belt holder at the top of the leaderboard."
Ken Boone,Ken,Uncle,Out sick.
Kent Ladig,Ladig,OG Adult,Ladig.
Kevin Vonarx,Kevin,OG Kid,Would probably be more comfortable if he could kick the ball into the hole. C-Flighter with the potential to dip into the bottom tier. One of the best soccer prospects to come out of St. Matthias since Jim Joyner.
Kyle Estes,Kyle,Kid,"Coming off his worst year yet, things aren’t likely to improve soon for this former A-Flighter."
Kyle Hirsch,Hirsch,Kid,"Plays a towering power draw. Don’t be surprised to see him hitting from a fairway or two over, but also don’t be surprised to see him in the A-Flight. Helped engineer all the doors on the golf karts…"
Kyle Huhmann,Kyle,Kid,Holds the course record at 140!
Mark Hirsch,,Adult,Father of Kyle Hirsch. 
Mark Sandweg,Bullseye,OG Adult,Good value compared to your typical C-Flight adult.
Matt Huhmann,Matt,OG Kid,Swing motto: “Aim left.” Swing thought: “God I hope I don’t accidently hit this straight.” Lifelong D-Flighter willing to shotgun start on every hole.
Mike Gorham,Gorham,DeSmet,"If you were able to look at him without being blinded, you’d be able to see that Gorham has been shooting up invitational leaderboards in recent years."
Mike Joyner,MJ,Friend of Brad,Deciding to ditch playing a power draw for a weak fade has yet to improve his scoring. Making his first Invitational appearance since 2018 so expect some fatigue issues in the afternoon rounds. Probably not as tough as Joe Thieman.
Mike Rulo,Nine Toe,Adult,One of the best Pound for Pound golfers in Invitational history.
Mike Sims,Sims,Adult,Probably the main reason Andy has yet to move the adults up a tee box. One of the most consistent performers in the field. 
Nick Wingbermuele,Wings,DeSmet (city version),Fastest clubhead speed in the field. Recent putting adjustments could see him contend for the belt someday.
Pat Book,Hector,Kid,Probably rocking a stache somewhere in Texas.
Ray Vien,The Rule Nazi,OG Adult,"Tournament Founder. Wily veteran finds a way to keep on posting sub 90 rounds. Don’t bet him that he can’t hit the 150-yard par 3 number 7 on Valley with a high, knock-down, cut driver…unless he gives you great odds."
Ron Gentile,Big Ron,Adult,Consistent shooter that can still find his way up to the top of the B-Flight.
Ronnie Gentile,Little Ron,Kid,"Pound for Pound, the longest hitter at the Invitational. Loves to ring the bell Hub’s Pub. Has well documented struggles with the shotgun start."
Scott Vince,,Adult,First appearance since 2016. Not much information to go on.
Tai Piazza,Tai,OG Kid,California living?
Tim Sandweg,Sandy,OG Kid,Skinny JJ? Winner of the most stuffed animals out of the Huddle House claw machine.
Tim Schuler,Schu Goat,Andy's Frat Bro,"All aboard the bogey train. Tim led all Invitational players with 12 bogies at the 2023 tournament. The ladies want him, and the Lacys want to be him."
Tim Thompson,Toolman,Adult,Consistent drawer of the golf ball. Has the lowest scoring average of the three Tims attending the tournament.
Tom Compton,T-Comp,DeSmet,Lefty hits a power draw with a low launch angle off the tee. Consistent scorer.  
Travis Edwards,T-Rav,Adult,Q: How is he off the tee? A: He’s the longest hitter out of the adults. Q: How’s his putting? A: He’s the longest hitter out of the adults.
Tyler Brown,Tyler Brown,Kid,Undefeated versus Swain in match play.
Uncle Bill,Uncle Bill,Uncle,GET YOU SOME!!
William Roberts,Son of Bill,Son of Bill,Son of Bill
